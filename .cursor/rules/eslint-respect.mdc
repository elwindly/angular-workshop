# Respect ESLint Rules

- **Always follow** the project's ESLint configuration (`eslint.config.js`).
- **Fix** any ESLint errors or warnings introduced by code changes.
- **Run** `ng lint` or `npx eslint .` when unsure; resolve reported issues before considering the task done.
- **Do not** disable or weaken rules without a documented justification; prefer fixing the code to satisfy the rule.
